## SincConv
A PyTorch 1.0 implementation of the bandpass convolutions described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09725 which efficient way to derive a customized filter bank tuned for the desired application. In our experiements this results in a significant reduction in time to convergence, and an increase in overall accuracy in audio domain tasks.
